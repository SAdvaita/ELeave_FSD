## Project Details
📌 Project Overview
E-Leave  is a full-stack, professional-grade Leave and Attendance Management System. It is designed to replace manual HR processes by offering automated leave balance tracking, holiday integration, real-time clock-in capabilities, and analytics for managers. The enhanced version focuses heavily on edge-case validation (e.g., leave without pay salary deductions, half-days, overlap detection, comp-offs) and provides an intuitive, analytics-driven dashboard.
